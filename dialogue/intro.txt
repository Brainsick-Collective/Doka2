Hey!
About time someone came. We've been working on this [`9]Server[`f] for ages!
Anyway.
Welcome to the game yada yada.

Look, theres a really annoying Mush Wiz somewhere in this area, he was supposed to be the intro quest, but he might be a little hard, we havent uh[*5]...[*3] play tested it yet.
don't worry about dying, for now you're all about even in strength so there won't be any preferential treatment to the winner, I just really want this guy out of here.
