# Untitled Dokapon Kingdom Clone (iteration 2)

Really there is no iteration 1 but i moved to the beta version of godot 3 very early so wanted to keep a separate repo in case anything was super messed up.

This will eventually be a GDD but for now its just empty

## Gameplay

This is currently designed to provide a demo, but most of the pieces and scenes are drag and dropable, given the global nodes are present. As it exists right now, the demo has one mob monster and one boss that spawns on a red tile near the bottom left of the map, you can have up to 4 players and whoever kills the boss first wins! leveling up system is in place to direct the character's stats, and player names are defaulted to their player id (+1). have fun and thanks for checking it out!


## Tools and codebase
like I said, i haven't worked this out yet, want to make a bigger doc describing scene and class behavior, but want to make a shoutout to SyndiBox, which I am using a lightly tweeked version of for my cutscene text display. Thanks! and to anyone curious about my design approach I promise that will be soon to come
