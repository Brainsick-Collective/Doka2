# Save Our System

SOS is a co-op rpg that plays like a board game. It encourages players to cooperate, and compete. There are two modes: Story, and Party. In the story mode, the players explore the world of Samsara, and learn about a dangerous evil that lurks inside the console.

This will eventually be a GDD but for now its just empty




## Tools and codebase
like I said, i haven't worked this out yet, want to make a bigger doc describing scene and class behavior, but want to make a shoutout to SyndiBox, which I am using a lightly tweeked version of for my cutscene text display. Thanks! and to anyone curious about my design approach I promise that will be soon to come.
